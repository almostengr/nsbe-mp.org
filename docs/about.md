## About The Chapter

National Society of Black Engineers Montgomery Professionals (NSBE-MP) Chapter is the local Montgomery Area chapter of a national organization of minority professionals educated and working in the STEM fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

NSBE-MP was founded in November 2001. A total of thirteen individuals with various engineering and technical disciplines came together in agreement and vowed to inform, teach, and educate others (especially our youth) on the importance of academic and professional development. With this determination and goal the NSBE-MP was chartered on February 19, 2002.

As a local chapter of NSBE, we are committed to *increasing the number of culturally responsible Black*
*Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.*
