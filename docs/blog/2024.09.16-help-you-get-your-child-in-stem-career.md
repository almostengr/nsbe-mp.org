title: How to Help Your Child Get Into a STEM Career
---

In today’s rapidly evolving world, careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) are in high demand. Helping your child prepare for a future in these fields can open doors to countless opportunities in technology, engineering, medicine, environmental science, and more. As a parent, there are several steps you can take to guide your child toward a rewarding STEM career.

## 1. Encourage Exploration and Curiosity

STEM careers begin with a passion for learning and curiosity about the world. Encourage your child to explore subjects like math and science at home and in school. Support hands-on activities, such as building with LEGOs, coding games, conducting simple experiments, or participating in STEM fairs and science clubs.

Exposing your child to various STEM-related activities helps spark interest and creativity, which are critical in pursuing a STEM career.

## 2. Get Involved in NSBE Jr.

If your child is interested in STEM, enrolling them in a supportive community like NSBE Jr. can make a significant difference. 

Our chapter’s **NSBE Jr. (National Society of Black Engineers Junior) program** is designed to inspire and empower young minds from elementary to high school. This program provides engaging activities and mentorship that encourages students to pursue careers in STEM fields.

NSBE Jr. meets on the **3rd Sunday of each month** during the school year, from **3 PM to 5 PM** at **H. Councill Trenholm Hall** on the campus of Alabama State University. It’s a great opportunity for students to build relationships with mentors and peers who share a passion for STEM.

## 3. Participate in NSBE Competitions and Conferences

One of the best ways for students to deepen their interest in STEM is by participating in **NSBE conventions** and competitions. Each year, NSBE hosts regional and national conventions where students have the opportunity to compete in a variety of STEM challenges, such as:

- **MathCounts**
- **Engineering Design Competition**
- **Robotics**
- **Science Fair**
- **Research Project Presentations**

These competitions provide students with hands-on experiences that are both fun and educational, and they allow them to showcase their skills to a larger audience.

Attending the **NSBE National Convention** gives students the chance to meet industry professionals, explore STEM careers, and participate in workshops that help them prepare for college and beyond. The competitions not only foster technical skills but also build confidence, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities—essential traits for a future in STEM.

## 4. Provide Access to STEM Resources

Giving your child access to STEM resources can further enhance their learning. Encourage them to explore educational websites, free coding platforms, STEM apps, and even YouTube tutorials on science and technology. Engaging with these tools helps students gain a better understanding of the practical applications of STEM concepts.

## 5. Stay Engaged and Supportive

Lastly, your involvement as a parent is crucial. Attend STEM-related events, help with school projects, and be actively involved in your child’s educational journey. Positive reinforcement and continued encouragement will keep your child motivated and excited about STEM.

## Conclusion

STEM careers offer limitless possibilities, and by supporting your child’s early interest, you can help them build a solid foundation for the future. Through programs like **NSBE Jr.** and opportunities like **NSBE convention competitions**, your child can gain valuable skills, exposure, and mentorship in the world of STEM.

By fostering their curiosity and providing access to a network of resources and role models, you’re giving your child the tools they need to succeed in a thriving and impactful field.
