NSBE-MP provides different levels of programming for the community and its members through a variety of programs.
NSBE TORCH (Technical OutReach and Community Help) 
Programs are designed to encourage students in grades K-12 and college to pursue a career in a
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) or 
STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) field. 
This is done by volunteering at STEM and STEAM community events, presenting about having a STEM career at local schools, 
and providing scholarships for students in the Montgomery and River Region.

## Central Alabama NSBE Jr Chapter (Pre-Collegiate Initiative)

NSBE Jr. (National Society of Black Engineers Junior) is a dynamic and engaging program designed 
to inspire and empower young minds in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
Geared towards grade school students, NSBE Jr. offers a supportive community and a range of enriching 
activities to foster a passion for STEM disciplines.

Members of our NSBE chapter and those from the community, generously donate money towards buying these items, which are then distributed to children in need. Through the Christmas Angel program, we aim to make a positive difference in the lives of children and families in our community, ensuring that every child receives a special gift during the holiday season.

You can make a difference by participating in the Christmas Angel program! Whether you contribute financially or volunteer your time to help organize and distribute gifts, your support is invaluable in spreading holiday cheer to those who need it most. Join us in making the holidays brighter for children in our community.
