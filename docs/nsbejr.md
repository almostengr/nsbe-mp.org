NSBE Jr. is the formal membership category for NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) pre-college
students which exists to fulfill NSBE's Pre-College Initiative (PCI). The Pre-College Initiative (PCI)
Program is designed to stimulate the interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields,
or STEM. The goal is to encourage students in grades 3-12 to attend college and pursue technical degrees.
Central Alabama NSBE Jr. program provides activities to help students discover firsthand how engineering
and technology relate to the world around them and discover the excitement of academic excellence,
leadership, technical development, and teamwork.
