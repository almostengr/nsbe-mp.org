NSBE Jr. is the formal membership category for members in grades K though 12th of the
National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). NSBE Jr. makes up an integral portion of the 
Pre-College Initiative (PCI) Program that is geared towards inspiring and igniting a passion for
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as creating an atmosphere
for students to develop valuable leadership skills. The mission of the PCI program is to "lead the
world in enhancing pre-college students' academic, technical and leadership skills to maximize
their success in life." The Central Alabama NSBE Jr. (CANSBEJr.) program provides activities
and events that promote our mission, as well as help students discover firsthand how
engineering and technology relate to the world around us and the excitement that it brings!!
