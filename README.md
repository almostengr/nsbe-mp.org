## Description

In the past, this website ran on Drupal 7. Since Drupal 7 retirement date was approaching, the website
was converted over to a static website so that less maintenance had to be performed on the website and that 
non-technical users could easily make updates to the website.

## Branches 

### master (default)

Branch that contains the Markdown files and templated code for the repository. 

### website

The generated HTML code from the Markdown files in main branch. The branch is built by GitHub Actions.
