NSBE-MP was founded in November 2001. A total of thirteen individuals with various engineering and technical disciplines came together in agreement and vowed to inform, teach, and educate others (especially our youth) on the importance of academic and professional development. With this determination and goal the NSBE-MP was chartered on February 19, 2002. As a local chapter of NSBE, we are committed to increasing the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community. Awards 2019 NSBE Region 3 Pre-College Initiative (PCI) Program of the Year 2018-2019 NSBE Professionals Silver Chapter 2017-2018 NSBE Professionals Certified Chapter NSBE Mission NSBE's mission is \"to increase the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.\" NSBE History In 1971, two Purdue undergraduate students, Edward Barnette (now deceased) and Fred Cooper approached the dean of engineering at Purdue University with the concept of starting the Black Society of Engineers (BSE). They wanted to establish a student organization to help improve the recruitment and retention of black engineering students. In the late 1960s, a devastating 80 percent of the black freshmen entering the engineering program dropped out. The dean agreed to the idea and assigned the only black faculty member on staff, Arthur J. Bond, as advisor. Barnett served as the first president of the BSE. The fledging group gained momentum in 1974, with the direction and encouragement of Bond and the active participation of the young men whose destiny was to become the founders of NSBE. Now known as the \"Chicago Six\", these men are Anthony Harris, Brian Harris, Stanley L. Kirtley, John W. Logan, Jr., Edward A. Coleman, and George A. Smith. Encouraged by their on-campus success, Anthony Harris, president of the Purdue chapter, wrote a letter to the presidents and deans of every accredited engineering program in the country (288), explained the Society of Black Engineers (SBE) concept and asked them to identify black student leaders, organizations and faculty members who might support their efforts on a national basis. Approximately 80 schools responded. Many had similar Black student organizations with similar objectives. A date was set for the first national meeting and 48 students representing 32 schools attended the event, held April 10-12, 1975. Harris also changed the organizations' nomenclature from the BSE to the Society of Black Engineers (SBE). It was at that historic meeting through majority vote, that SBE became the National Society of Black Engineers. The familiar NSBE symbol \"N\" with lightning bolts was chosen and it remains a distinctively recognizable symbol representing the premier technical organization for African American engineering students and professionals. NSBE was eventually incorporated in Texas, in 1976 as a non-profit organization. John Cason, also of Purdue, served as the first elected president of NSBE. As the organization grew, Virginia Booth became the first female National Chairperson and the first to serve two terms 1978-1980. NSBE has since grown from six to over 30,000 members and the annual meeting has blossomed into an annual National Convention, hosting over 8,000 attendees. NSBE has over 270 student and 50 professional chapters. Headquartered in Alexandria, Va., NSBE offers academic excellence programs, scholarships, leadership training, professional development and access to career opportunities for thousands of members annually. With over 2,000 elected leadership positions, 12 regional conferences and an annual convention, NSBE provides opportunities for success that remain unmatched by any other organization.","title":"About NSBE Montgomery Professionals"},{"location":"about/#nsbe-montgomery-professionals-executive-board-2025-2026","text":"","title":"NSBE Montgomery Professionals Executive Board 2025-2026"},{"location":"about/#rodney-zeigler-president","text":"","title":"Rodney Zeigler, President"},{"location":"about/#dontavious-sippial-president-elect","text":"","title":"Dontavious Sippial, President-Elect"},{"location":"about/#kenny-robinson-secretary","text":"","title":"Kenny Robinson, Secretary"},{"location":"about/#vacant-treasurer","text":"","title":"Vacant, Treasurer"},{"location":"about/#dontavious-sippial-programs-chair","text":"","title":"Dontavious Sippial, Programs Chair"},{"location":"about/#sonja-favors-delegate","text":"","title":"Sonja Favors, Delegate"},{"location":"about/#vacant-delegate","text":"","title":"Vacant, Delegate"},{"location":"about/#al-thomas-parliamentarian","text":"","title":"Al Thomas, Parliamentarian"},{"location":"about/#al-thomas-president-emeritus","text":"","title":"Al Thomas, President Emeritus"},{"location":"about/#latasha-merchant-telecommunications-chair","text":"","title":"LaTasha Merchant, Telecommunications Chair"},{"location":"about/#adam-sumbry-pci-pre-collegiate-initiative-chair-and-nsbe-jr-advisor","text":"","title":"Adam Sumbry, PCI (Pre-Collegiate Initiative) Chair and NSBE Jr Advisor"},{"location":"about/#tamaria-mcalpin-nsbe-jr-advisor","text":"","title":"Tamaria McAlpin, NSBE Jr Advisor"},{"location":"about/#earnest-colvin-scholarship-chair","text":"","title":"Earnest Colvin, Scholarship Chair"},{"location":"about/#vacant-membership-chair","text":"","title":"Vacant, Membership Chair"},{"location":"about/#rodney-zeigler-fundraising-chair","text":"","title":"Rodney Zeigler, Fundraising Chair"},{"location":"about/#nsbe-montgomery-professionals-history","text":"National Society of Black Engineers Montgomery Professionals (NSBE-MP) Chapter is the Montgomery, Alabama chapter of a national organization of minority professionals educated and working in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

Support hands-on activities, such as building with LEGOs, coding games, conducting simple experiments, or participating in STEM fairs and science clubs. Exposing your child to various STEM-related activities helps spark interest and creativity, which are critical in pursuing a STEM career. Get Involved in NSBE Jr. If your child is interested in STEM, enrolling them in a supportive community like NSBE Jr. can make a significant difference. Our chapter\u2019s NSBE Jr. (National Society of Black Engineers Junior) program is designed to inspire and empower young minds from elementary to high school. This program provides engaging activities and mentorship that encourages students to pursue careers in STEM fields. NSBE Jr. meets on the 3rd Sunday of each month during the school year, from 3 PM to 5 PM at H. Councill Trenholm Hall on the campus of Alabama State University. It\u2019s a great opportunity for students to build relationships with mentors and peers who share a passion for STEM. For more details on how to get your child involved, visit the NSBE Jr. page . Participate in NSBE Competitions and Conferences One of the best ways for students to deepen their interest in STEM is by participating in NSBE conventions and competitions. Each year, NSBE hosts regional and national conventions where students have the opportunity to compete in a variety of STEM challenges, such as: MathCounts Engineering Design Competition Robotics Science Fair Research Project Presentations These competitions provide students with hands-on experiences that are both fun and educational, and they allow them to showcase their skills to a larger audience. Attending the NSBE National Convention gives students the chance to meet industry professionals, explore STEM careers, and participate in workshops that help them prepare for college and beyond. The competitions not only foster technical skills but also build confidence, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities\u2014essential traits for a future in STEM.

Engaging with these tools helps students gain a better understanding of the practical applications of STEM concepts. Stay Engaged and Supportive Lastly, your involvement as a parent is crucial. Attend STEM-related events, help with school projects, and be actively involved in your child\u2019s educational journey. Positive reinforcement and continued encouragement will keep your child motivated and excited about STEM. Conclusion STEM careers offer limitless possibilities, and by supporting your child\u2019s early interest, you can help them build a solid foundation for the future. Through programs like NSBE Jr. and opportunities like NSBE convention competitions , your child can gain valuable skills, exposure, and mentorship in the world of STEM. By fostering their curiosity and providing access to a network of resources and role models, you\u2019re giving your child the tools they need to succeed in a thriving and impactful field.
