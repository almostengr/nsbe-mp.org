## About NSBE Montgomery Professionals

NSBE's mission is "to increase the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community." 

The Montgomery Professionals chapter was founded in 2002 and chartered in November 2001. Since then, we have strived to educate students about the field of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and a rewarding career that you can have as a STEM professional.
